Diagnosis of MCMC performance
-----------------------------
This is a quick and dirty document for my own reference only.

Extracted from my head, a talk by Brian Moore (http://treethinkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MCMC.pdf), a beast tutorial on ESSs(http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/increasing-esss), the decronization forum (http://treethinkers.blogspot.ch/2009/05/for-this-unauthorized-installment-of.html), and the documentation of RWTY(https://github.com/danlwarren/RWTY).

Tracer is used mostly for continuous parameters, while RWTY for discrete parameters (topology).

-Single chain
	-Convergence
		-Tracer:
			-Time-series trace: Must stabilize. May jump before convergence. 
				-Slow convergence (continuous change: underparameterized model, scale too small (acceptance too high) or inappropriate priors)
				-Decrease in loglikelihood after an initial steady increase: over-parameterization, unrealistic priors or weak parameters
			
		-AWTY/RWTY:
			-Cumulative split frequency: must stabilize
			-Cumulative change in split frequency : muts get to really low values over time
			
	-Mixing
		-Tracer:
			-Fuzzy caterpillar
			-ACT (max:sampling frequency, ideal: not too far)
			-Marginal posteriors with reasonable shape: multimodal distributions show non-identifiability between two (or more) parameters.
			
		-RWTY:
			-MDS of tree distances well distributed.
			-Split frequency sliding window: must mix well.
			-Split frequency change sliding window: must be flat.
			-Autocorrelation plots: flat lines (no autocorrelation whatsoever).
			
		-Operator acceptance: 0.2 ~ 0.7 (to increase rate decrease scale)
	
	-Sample size (related to mixing+length)
		-Tracer(continuous)+RWTY(trees): ESS >200 (at least >100). Ideal = n_samples. If it is close to the ideal, you can increase the sampling frequency to get more samples with the same data, since the autocorrelation is 0.
		
-Prior (run the program sampling only the prior)
	-Tracer: Check that the posterior is not almost just the prior
	
-Multiple chains
	The more the better. Two is quite low. For example, in a scenario with 2 real optima, you would have a 50% chance of sampling the same optima, getting posteriors of 1 when they should be 0.5.

	-Convergence:
		-Tracer: 
			- Compare marginal posterior distributions.
		-R(EDISON package)/MrBayes
			- Calculate the PSRF (should be 1)
		-RWTY(MrBayes also for the ASDSF)
			- Calculate the average standard deviation of split frequency (should be below 0.01, over-parameterized (or with bad priors) models usually oscillate).
			- MDS: Exploring the same area of the space.
			- Split frequency scatterplot matrix: the split frequency of one split must be the same in each pair of chains.
